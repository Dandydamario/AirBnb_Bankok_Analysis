## Background
Airbnb is an online marketplace that allows individuals to rent out their properties or spare rooms to travelers. It provides an alternative accommodation option to traditional hotels and has gained popularity worldwide. In Bangkok, Airbnb has experienced significant growth, attracting both hosts and guests seeking unique and affordable accommodations.

## Problem Statement
The problem faced by the company is the lack of alignment between the distribution of rooms and the characteristics of each area in Bangkok. Insufficient variation in room types that cater to the specific needs and preferences of consumers in each area can hinder the company's ability to meet customer demand effectively. This mismatch can result in a decreased market appeal and potential loss of opportunities to increase sales.
